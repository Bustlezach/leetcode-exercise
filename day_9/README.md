# QUESTION 1:
Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array-You are given an array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1]. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# QUESTION 2:
Search in 2D Array-Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.

The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

If the value is there in the matrix return true, else false.

# QUESTION3:
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in num1 and num2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-deceasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instaed should be stored inside the array nums1. To accomodate this, nums1 has a length of m+n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the lst n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. num2 has a length of n.
