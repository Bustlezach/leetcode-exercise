# Question 1: 
Reverse SLL - You are given the head of a Singly Linked list. Write a function that will take the given head as input, reverse the Linked List and return the new head of the reversed Linked List.

# Question 2:
Cycle Detection - You are given the head of a linked list. Check if there is a cycle and if yes,  return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Do not modify the linked list.
