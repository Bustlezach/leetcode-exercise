## QUESTION 1:

Two Sum - You are given an array of integers and another integer targetValue. Write a function that will take these inputs and return the indices of the two integers in the array that add up the targetValue.


## QUESTION 2:

Isomorphic strings - Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t are isomophic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself. s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
